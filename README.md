# Loading-Product - Async-Await
This is a mini project on loading products on a page using Async / Await / Promise.

🛒 Mini Product Loader

Description:
A small project in plain JavaScript demonstrating asynchronous programming, Promises, async/await, error handling, and displaying a loader during data fetching.
The project simulates loading products from a "server" and shows how to handle the workflow:
Clicking the button starts the loading process.
While waiting for the data, a loader is displayed.
Once the data is received, the products are rendered in a list.
If an error occurs, it is displayed to the user.
The loader is hidden in any case after the process finishes.

Technologies:
HTML / CSS
JavaScript (ES6+)
Promise / async/await
DOM manipulation
Project Features:
Pure JavaScript, no frameworks or libraries
Realistic async behavior with error handling
Loader and dynamic product list visualization
Great practice for beginner frontend developers

How to Use:
Clone the repository
